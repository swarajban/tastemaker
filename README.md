## About
Tastemaker is an app to help plan which meals to cook for the week. Simply add your
meal items and the app will generate a schedule for you. You can specify tags
for each meal and generate schedules that can prevent multiple meals with same
tag from being scheduled on the same day, e.g. don't have potatoes twice in a day.

## Stack
Tastemaker is built in React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Supabase. We use
Supabase for both authentication and database. The app is hosted on Netlify.
100% of the code was written by Cursor/Sonnet/OpenAI generations; I didn't 
write a single line of code myself.
